# Horizon HDFC - Contributing
My goal is that I can pass the general content creation to someone else. So, this doc is for me and for the current/next person or group of people to manage content

## Content Updates
How to update content on the site

### Homepage
[index.md](/src/content/markdown/index.md) 
- Announcements are managed in our horizonhdfc-cms under [announcements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yzgelw9d3JjGJzMrwV_xbOUDCCZ1XpACX4oXlvujTUw/edit?gid=1031074610#gid=1031074610)
   - there is a **Go Live** column. This is a `boolean` field that determines whether the announcement is shown on the live site
